    <h1>FSaaS Manifesto</h1>
    <h2>(Failed-State-as-a-Service)</h2>
    <h2>"Infrastructure is a shared responsibility. So why are we doing it alone?"</h2>

    <p>We are uncovering better ways of surviving collapsed systems by doing it ourselves, and helping each other, through this work.</p>

    <p>Through our experience, frustration, duct-tape repairs, and sleepless nights, we have come to value:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local data</strong> over corporate excuses</li>
      <li><strong>Neighborhood collaboration</strong> over centralized control</li>
      <li><strong>Real-time monitoring</strong> over vague service windows</li>
      <li><strong>DIY resilience</strong> over passive dependence</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That is, while there is value in the broken infrastructure we inherited, we value the <strong>tools we build together</strong> far more.</p>

    <h2>We believe:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No one should be billed for services they didn’t receive.</li>
      <li>Access to basic utilities is not a privilege - it’s a baseline we should own.</li>
      <li>Sensors and software can make visible what others pretend doesn’t exist.</li>
      <li>One person shouldn't carry the burden of keeping the lights on for an entire street.</li>
      <li>Shared knowledge is stronger than isolated struggle.</li>
      <li>Data is the new megaphone - and we will shout with it.</li>
      <li>Cooperation, not extraction, is the path to prosperity.</li>
      <li>Anger is valid. And also: measurable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>We are building:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Local systems for water, power, internet, and waste monitoring</li>
      <li>Transparent dashboards for communities to track what’s really happening</li>
      <li>Alerts that are honest, fast, and not filtered through bureaucracy</li>
      <li>Ways to trade energy, labor, and tools outside the systems that failed us</li>
      <li>A network of humans who look out for each other, not for profit, but to thrive</li>
    </ul>

      We are not waiting for rescue. We are building the alternative.<br />
      We are not powerless. We are post-grid.
